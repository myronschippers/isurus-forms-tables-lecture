# Forms and Tables

Taking a look at how to strip data from forms and then add that data to an HTML table.

## Creating a Table

First let's scaffold in a table without any thought for the data. Every table has a head, body, and footer. Their corresponding tags are `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`. within each of these tags our data structure has to fit within a row and column structure.

```HTML
<table>
    <thead>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
    </tfoot>
</table>
```
